# Anima Alchemy  

This mod started as an Add-on for the great mod "Elders Faction" by xrushha. 
Now it only requires "Anima Gear" as a dependency as it uses the farmable anima fibers for the drug recipes.

## Content
Added two new drugs that replenish psyfocus and boost psychic attributes :
- Anima Pill : the basic product
- Anima Golden Pill : the advanced version
These pills are high cost and high effort to produce or procure for their amazing effects that can be of assistance in critical situations. Of course the wealthy enjoy them as a recreational drug, but let's stick to the tribals who can produce them! 

## Roadmap
- People producing or consuming the pills need Natural meditation focus
- Genes to go with the new drug for imperviousness etc
- More Alchemy products, such as the lesser potions, where each item focuses on specific psychic attribute at a time.
- A few traits that go with Alchemy

This is my first try at modding with a shallow programming knowledge at best, so any constructive feedback is welcomeand very much appreciated. Needless to say this is a work in progress.  

Enjoy responsibly! 
Peace!
